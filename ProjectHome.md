RecordStream is a set of commandline tools for linux.  These scripts help to splice and dice data on the commandline.  Data is passed around in JSON format.  Streams of JSON records are produced from source data with 'from' scripts, manipulation scripts can get be used to do queries on the data or transforms of the data, then output scripts, or 'to' scripts, produce human output.  Output can take the form of text files, HTML tables, or even writes to databases or webservices.
